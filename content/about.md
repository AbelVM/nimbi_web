# About nimbi

## "nimbi"?

**nimbi** is a latin word, the plural form of **nimbus**, a kind of cloud that bears rain.

## What's nimbi?

**nimbi** is a canvas, a placeholder for thoughts, articles, side-projects, etc. to be called my own.

Technically, the target was to deploy a selfmade frankenweb, SPA + CMS, 100% clientside, with lots of random CSS stuff and **based on markdown files**. To achieve this very last requirement, I have used a "slightly" tuned version of [MDwiki](http://www.mdwiki.info)

The blueprint of **nimbi** is something like this

I don't know where is it headed to, but, in the meantime, let's have fun while listening to good music.
